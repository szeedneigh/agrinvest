# AGRiNVEST Lean Canvas V2

## 1. Problem

### For Farmers:
- **Catastrophic financial risk** from events (climate, pests)
- **Lack of access to fair, risk-tolerant capital** (trapped by predatory loans)
- **Powerlessness against middlemen** due to a lack of market data

### For Young Investors:
- **Lack of trustworthy, accessible channels** for meaningful impact investing
- **Perception that significant capital is required** to start investing

## 2. Customer Segments

### Producers:
- **Primary:** Smallholder farmers & food producers in the Philippines
- **Early Adopters:** Tech-receptive rice farmers in Central Luzon

### Investors:
- **Primary:** Gen-Z and Millennial Filipinos (students, young professionals)
- **Early Adopters:** Socially-conscious youth in student organizations and online communities

## 3. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

### For Farmers:
> **AGRiNVEST is a Shield and a Weapon.** We provide interest-free capital that protects you from debt, and the data you need to fight for fair prices.

### For Investors:
> **AGRiNVEST lets you become a hero.** Turn your spare 50 pesos into a powerful, tangible investment in our nation's food producers.

## 4. Solution

- **Mobile-First Platform with an "AGRiNVEST Wallet":** Allows for seamless, low-fee, in-app reinvestment
- **Gamified Social Investing:** Features like badges, leaderboards, and shareable updates to drive community engagement and viral growth
- **Data Collection & Insights Engine:** Aggregates funding and harvest data to provide market leverage for farmers

## 5. Channels

### To Investors:
- Viral social media marketing (TikTok, Facebook)
- Partnerships with student organizations & youth influencers
- A "Pioneer" referral program

### To Farmers:
- Direct on-the-ground partnerships with trusted local entities:
  - Farmer Cooperatives
  - LGUs (Local Government Units)
  - Department of Agriculture

## 6. Revenue Streams

### Phase 1 (Growth):
- **Transaction Fees on Withdrawals:** A small fee when investors cash out from their wallet to an external account (e.g., GCash)
- **(Optional) 1% commission** on net profit of successful cycles (early survival raft)

### Phase 2 (Scale):
- **B2B partnerships** (e-commerce vouchers, targeted ads)
- **Licensing of anonymized, aggregated agricultural data**

## 7. Cost Structure

- **Platform Development & Maintenance** (salaries, servers, security)
- **Payment Gateway & Withdrawal Fees** (Cost of moving money in/out of the ecosystem)
- **Legal, Regulatory & Compliance Costs** (Critical for a FinTech platform)
- **On-the-ground Partner Support** (Building the farmer network)
- **Digital Marketing & Community Management**

## 8. Key Metrics

### The North Star Metric:
- **Monthly Active Investors**

### Growth Engine:
- **Investor Acquisition Cost (IAC)**
- **K-Factor (virality)**

### Farmer Side:
- **# of Farmers Funded**
- **Total Capital Deployed**
- **Crop Success Rate**

### Platform Health:
- **Total Value in Wallets (TVW)**
- **Re-investment Rate**

## 9. Unfair Advantage

### The Data Engine:
Our aggregated agricultural data will become a proprietary, game-changing asset that is very difficult to replicate.

### The Community & Brand:
By building a cause-driven "hero" brand for Gen-Z, we will create a powerful network effect and community loyalty that transactional platforms (like Cropital) cannot easily copy.

### The Founder Story & Farmer Network:
Your authentic connection to the community provides an initial trust advantage that is impossible to buy.

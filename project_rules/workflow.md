## ðŸš¨ Critical Environment Rules (Must Follow)

### 1. Environment Variables Management
- **Rule**: All environment-specific settings must be managed via `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`
- **Security**: Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or sensitive data directly in code
- **Client Variables**: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix only for variables safe to expose on the client
- **Documentation**: Document all required environment variables in `.env.example`

### 2. Environment Validation
- **Rule**: Validate environment variables at runtime using libraries like Zod or envsafe
- **Implementation**: Create a centralized env validation module
- **Example**:
  ```typescript
  // lib/env.ts
  import { z } from 'zod';
  
  const envSchema = z.object({
    DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET: z.string().min(1),
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL: z.string().url(),
    // Add all required env vars
  });
  
  export const env = envSchema.parse(process.env);
  ```

### 3. Security Best Practices
- **Rule**: Avoid leaking server-only environment variables into client-side bundles
- **Validation**: Ensure no sensitive data is exposed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- **Review**: Regularly audit environment variable usage

## ðŸ”„ Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```
main                    # Production branch
â”œâ”€â”€ develop            # Development integration branch
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/crop-list  # Feature branches
â”œâ”€â”€ bugfix/auth-issue  # Bug fix branches
â””â”€â”€ hotfix/security    # Emergency fixes
```

### Commit Conventions
- **Format**: `type(scope): description`
- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- **Examples**:
  ```
  feat(crops): add crop filtering functionality
  fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue
  docs(api): update endpoint documentation
  test(components): add CropCard component tests
  ```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
2. **Make Changes**: Follow coding standards and write tests
3. **Commit Changes**: Use conventional commit messages
4. **Push Branch**: `git push origin feature/feature-name`
5. **Create PR**: Include description, testing notes, and screenshots
6. **Code Review**: Address feedback and make changes
7. **CI Checks**: Ensure all tests and linting pass
8. **Merge**: Squash and merge to main branch
